# FluxGym Application Configuration

## Runpod Configuration (Already Included!)

Good news: **app.py already has the correct Runpod configuration!**

### Current Configuration in app.py

**Line 1378** - Logo with proxy path:
```html
<img id='logo' src='/proxy/7860/file=icon.png' width='80' height='80'>
```

**Line 1689** - Demo launch with root_path:
```python
demo.launch(
    server_name="0.0.0.0",
    server_port=7860,
    root_path="/proxy/7860",
    debug=True,
    show_error=True,
    allowed_paths=[cwd]
)
```

### Why This Works on Runpod

✅ **`server_name="0.0.0.0"`** - Binds to all network interfaces (allows external access)
✅ **`server_port=7860`** - Standard FluxGym port
✅ **`root_path="/proxy/7860"`** - Tells Gradio it's behind Runpod's proxy
✅ **Logo path `/proxy/7860/file=icon.png`** - Correctly routes through proxy

### What Doesn't Work

❌ **Without root_path:**
```python
demo.launch(debug=True, show_error=True, allowed_paths=[cwd])
```
Result: Gradio doesn't know it's behind a proxy, routing fails

❌ **Without server_name/server_port:**
```python
demo.launch(root_path="/proxy/7860", debug=True, show_error=True, allowed_paths=[cwd])
```
Result: Might not bind to 0.0.0.0, external access fails

## No Separate Version Needed!

**Previous assumption was wrong.** We don't need app_runpod.py because:

1. The `root_path="/proxy/7860"` IS required for Runpod
2. It's already correctly configured in app.py
3. No patching or file copying needed

---

## Runpod Deployment

The startup script simply runs app.py directly:

```bash
nohup python app.py > fluxgym.log 2>&1 &
```

No modifications needed! ✅

## If You Need Local Deployment

**For local deployment** (without proxy), you can temporarily modify line 1689:

```python
# Local version (no proxy)
demo.launch(
    server_name="127.0.0.1",  # localhost only
    server_port=7860,
    debug=True,
    show_error=True,
    allowed_paths=[cwd]
)
```

But the Runpod version with `root_path="/proxy/7860"` should work locally too - just access via `http://localhost:7860/proxy/7860/`

---

## Changes From Original FluxGym

Compared to the original FluxGym, we've added:

1. ✅ **`server_name="0.0.0.0"`** - For cloud access
2. ✅ **`server_port=7860`** - Explicit port
3. ✅ **`root_path="/proxy/7860"`** - Runpod proxy support
4. ✅ **Logo path with `/proxy/7860/`** - Correct asset routing

---

## Troubleshooting

### "404 Not Found" errors for assets
**Cause:** Logo or other assets not routing through proxy
**Fix:** Ensure paths include `/proxy/7860/` prefix (already done in app.py)

### "Connection refused"
**Cause:** Not binding to 0.0.0.0
**Fix:** Ensure `server_name="0.0.0.0"` (already done in app.py)

### "Page won't load" on Runpod
**Cause:** Missing root_path
**Fix:** Ensure `root_path="/proxy/7860"` (already done in app.py)

---

## Summary

✅ **app.py is already Runpod-ready!**
✅ **No patching needed**
✅ **No separate version needed**
✅ **Just clone and run**

The current app.py configuration works perfectly for:
- Runpod
- Vast.ai
- Lambda Labs
- Other cloud platforms with proxy routing
- Local deployment (with proxy path)
